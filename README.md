# Hardware-accelerated Sorting Algorithm

## About

Hardware-accelerated sorting algorithm in which unsorted **data elements are presented serially and
evaluated against the sorted collection of data elements in parallel**. The algorithm is implemented
on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 AP SoC XC7Z020-CLG484-1 found on the ZedBoard but does not use IP cores and
can be implemented on any other FPGA.
